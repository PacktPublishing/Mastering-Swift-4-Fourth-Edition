## About the Book
The key features of Swift 4.0 and quickly learn how to use the newest updates to your development advantage. From Objective-C interoperability to ARC, to closures and concurrency, this advanced Swift guide will develop your expertise and make you more fluent in this vital programming language.

We give you in-depth knowledge of some of the most sophisticated elements of Swift development including protocol extensions, error-handling, design patterns, and concurrency, and guide you on how to use and apply them in your own projects. You'll see how to leverage the power of Protocol-Oriented programming to write cleaner and easier-to-manage code. We will also show you how Apple uses Protocol-Oriented programming techniques in the Swift Standard library.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
var name1 = "Jon" 
var name2 = "Kim" 
var name3 = "Kailey" 
var name4 = "Kara"
```

To follow along with the examples in this book, you'll need to have an Apple computer with OS X 10.13 or higher installed. You'll also need to install Xcode version 9.0 or higher with Swift version 4 or higher.
